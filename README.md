# Advice-Generator
Advice Generator Challenge from Front-End Mentor. 

# About
This was originally a project made by Front-End Mentor that I decided to pick up as I wanted more experience playing around with API. 

While my solution was not flawless, I did as much as I can to come close to the original photo given to me by Front-End API. Feel free to use it or do whatever you wish with the original code! :)



## Usage

While this is a very simple web application, you can generate advice within the API to get a piece of advice that you might really need to get through a tough day!
All you have to do is just hit the dice button and generate the piece of advice you may need!

## Contributing
Feel free to do whatever you wish with my project, as this was just a simple project, as I had mentioned earlier, to give me more experience messing around with APIs and random generation.
